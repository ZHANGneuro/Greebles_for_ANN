### -Dataset and features:
There are 2072 Greeble-like images, each of them has two features: `Toogit (T)` and `Vacso (V)`, which varies from 1 to 5 unit of length. The ratio of T & V (i.e. T/V) was represented by a point on sunbrust map with a center point defined at [3,3]. <br />
 <br />
 
The Greebles were categorized into two 'families': `Family_1` & `Family_2` depending on the line orientation on the map that the point locates. <br /> <br />
Family_1: `0°`，`60°`，`120°`，`180°`，`240°`，`300°` <br />
Family_2：`30°`，`90°`，`150°`，`210°`，`270°`，`330°` <br />
 <br />
 
 ```diff
! For the number of greebles, there are on average 251 greebles for each of 12 orientations with identified step size.<br />

! The greeble file was named as family-alignment (align or misalign)-ori-angle(0、30\ etc.)-xaxis-unit of length-yaxis-unit of length <br />

```



### -Goal
Training ANN to recognize the family (Family_1 or Family_2) given a specific greeble.
