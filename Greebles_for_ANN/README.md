# Greebles_for_ANN

Dataset and features:

There are 2072 Greeble-like images, each of them has two features: Toogit (T) and Vacso (V), which varies from 1 to 4 unit of length. The ratio of T & V (i.e. T/V) was represented by a point on sunbrust map with a center point defined at [2,2] 

The Greebles were categorized into two 'families': Family_1 & Family_2 depending on the line orientation on the map that the point locates.
Family_1: 0°，60°，120°，180°，240°，300°
Family_2：30°，90°，150°，210°，270°，330°


Purpose:

for ANN training purpose

with 'Toogit' and 'Vacso' change from 1 to 4 units in length
